// Package extractor implements the background memory extraction subagent.
//
// The extraction agent runs as a perfect fork of the main conversation — same system prompt, same
// message prefix. The main agent's system prompt always has full save instructions; when the main
// agent writes memories itself, extractor.Execute skips that turn (hasMemoryWritesSince). This
// prompt fires only when the main agent didn't write, so the save-criteria here overlap the system
// prompt's harmlessly.
